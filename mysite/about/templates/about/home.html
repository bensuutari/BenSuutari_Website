I am a graudate student pursuing my PhD in neuroscience at New York University's Center for Neural Science.  I'm currently studying how serotonin can modulate complex interconnected networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to promote information fidelity in the hippocampus.  I use a combination of experimental and computational techniques to devise theoretical models and then test their predictions empirically.  
<br>
<br>
Before coming to graduate school I did my undergraduate studies in physics at Florida Atlantic University and the University of Tokushima.  In addition to my graduate neuroscience work I have performed research in medical physics (under Zoubir Ouhib), quantum cryptography (under Dr. Warner Miller) and electroencephalography (under Dr. Emmanuelle Tognoli and Dr. J.A. Scott Kelso).  I have wide interests, but my real passion that underlies all of the studies I have pursued is information theory and how data influences the physical world.

<p>I am a graudate student pursuing my PhD in Neural Science at New York University's Center for Neural Science.  My bachelor's degree is in physics and I have extensive experience with many aspects of expermental and computational physics and neuroscience. In 2009 I obtained by bachelor of science degree in physics from Florida Atlantic Univesity (FAU).  From 2009 to 2011 I participate in research in Dr. Warner Miller's Laboratorty and Dr. Emanuelle Tognoli's Lab studying Quantum Cyptography and Electroencephplography, resepectively. In Dr. Miller's Lab I studied effective computational models of conveying Quantum Key Distribution using orbital angular momentum photons.  In Dr. Tognoli's lab I studied neural electroencephalographical correlates of coordination between partners coordinating in a complex motor task.  After a couple of years in the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences at FAU, I decided to pursue PhD in neuroscience at the New York Univesity (NYU) Center for Neural Science.  In August 2011, I began by PhD studies at NYU with intentions to integrate experimental and computational methods in the study of neuronal circuits.  Dr. Richard Tsien was amenbable to my diverse interests and agreed to be my doctoral adviser.  
<br>
<br>
Dr. Tsien is a world-renowed scientist with extensive experience in neuronal biophysics, networks and even behavior. Given his experience, knowledge and reputation I was intially quite intimidated to join his lab, but I persisted in hopes that a bit of his genius would percolate to me!  In the last 6 years, I think that some of his genius has made its way into my brain.  His advising has been indespensible and I've learned immesurable volumes about how to be a meticulous and thorough scientist. My diverse background has exposed me to various aspects of phyisics and neuroscience leading me to a general interest in information theory, spanning systems as small and fundamental as a photon to as interconnected and complex as the human brain.</p>  

<p>I have a wide varieties of inerests, ranging from languages to complex systems to basic, funamental physics.  One of my most formative experiences was in the study abroad that I particapted in at the University of Tokushima in Japan from April 2006 - June 2007.  There I was exposed to a completely different culture as well as new, cutting edge research.  At the University of Tokushima I studied Japanese and Dark Matter Detection under the advising of Dr. Zenro Hioki.  This experience was integral to my development as I learned values from Japanese culture as well as foundational research techniques in some of the most innovative and creative research in dark matter detection.  I have long been an enthusiast of Japanese culture and physics so this experience was an ideal combination of learning experiences in some of my most impressionable years in undergraduate education.  I met many interesting friends and learned many new societal and scientific values that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.  A year may seem like a rather brief period in the course of a human life but this experience for me held some of my fondest memories and I will always hold the University of Tokushima and the people of the city of Tokushima in high esteem.
